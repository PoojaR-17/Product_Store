Features
1. Product Store (index.html)
Displays a list of products dynamically.
Allows users to filter products by category using a dropdown.
Includes sorting options to order products by price (ascending/descending).
Pagination for browsing through multiple pages of products.
A link to navigate to the shopping cart.
2. Cart (cart.html)
Displays items added to the cart.
Includes a "Back to Home" link to return to the Product Store.
3. JavaScript Logic (index.js)
Examples of JavaScript operations including:
Array manipulation (push, pop, reverse, map).
Alphabet generation and mapping positions.
String reversal (functionality incomplete in provided code).
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files to your local system.
Ensure the following file structure is maintained:
index.html and cart.html in the root directory.
Any CSS or JS files in the same directory or paths referenced in HTML.
Open index.html in a web browser to start the application.
Requirements
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modify or extend the application.
Potential Enhancements
Complete the JavaScript logic for reversing strings and other functionality.
Add functionality to save cart items locally using localStorage or sessionStorage.
Implement a backend to fetch and save products and cart data.
Improve styling by completing the styles.css file.

Functionalities of the Product Store Project
1. Dynamic Product Listing
Displays a list of products dynamically loaded via JavaScript.
Each product includes details like name, price, and category (assumed based on the structure).
2. Filtering
Users can filter products by category using a dropdown menu.
Helps narrow down product searches based on preferences.
3. Sorting
Users can sort products by price in ascending or descending order.
Sorting options:
Price: Low to High
Price: High to Low
4. Pagination
Enables browsing through multiple pages of products.
Prevents overwhelming users with too many items at once.
5. Shopping Cart
Add to Cart: Products can be added to a virtual cart (not implemented yet).
View Cart: Users can view their selected products on the cart.html page.
"Back to Home" navigation link for easy return to the product store.
6. JavaScript Operations
Demonstrates advanced JavaScript array manipulation (examples provided in index.js).
Includes:
Array transformations using map.
Reverse string function (needs debugging/completion).
Generating the English alphabet programmatically.
Future Functionalities to Implement
Add to Cart Functionality: Allow users to add specific products to the cart with a button.
Persist Cart Data: Use localStorage or a backend API to store cart data across sessions.
Product Details: Add functionality to view detailed information about a product.
Checkout Process: Allow users to proceed with their cart to place orders.
Responsive Design: Enhance layout for mobile and tablet devices.
This project currently serves as a strong foundation for expanding into a fully functional e-commerce application.
